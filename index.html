											<h2>Project Overview</h2>
										</header>
										<p class='content'>Since this past summer, I have been working with multiple teams of students, teachers, and administrators at Rindge in rolling out equity-focused computer science outreach initiative. In July, I worked with a team in designing and ultimaetly teaching lessons for a 2-week APCS/APCSP preview course. This fall, under the mentorship of my senior project advisors, I have been studying social theories and the essential pieces of literature related to the topic of education for liberation. Utilizing wisdom from late educators like Ella Baker and Paulo Freire, I worked to redevelop the framework of the CS summer preview program. Since this December, I have also been working with another team at CRLS in planning a school-wide, week-long, and equity-focused CS outreach event, tentatively named "Tinker for Change." We plan to reach out to CRLS student groups working on initiatives related to social change and equity to see if they would like to work with us. Together, we would work to encourage other CRLS students to try using programming as a tool to work towards social change. As a high school senior, this project matters a lot to me. Throughout these four years of high school, I have studied computer science in various settings, including taking CS classes at Rindge, self-studying, attending 24-hour hackathon events in pre-pandemic times, and programming as part of internships and projects in the States, France, and Taiwan. Having had these experiences, I understand the importance of amplifying opportunities and providing support systems for new programmers from underrepresented groups in computing. With this project, I hope to work with my differnt teams to encourage students of more backgrounds at Rindge to try CS.</p>

									<h2>Product</h2>
									<p>As my project is focused around gaining understanding of social theories surrounding education for liberation, developing workshops, and organizing meetings, I made the decision to not build something tangible as my 'final project'; unlike conventional senior projects, my project is focused around using half of the time to gain understanding of social theories and case studies and the other half to work with different teams to launch projects seeking to work towards equity in computing (praxis, in a sense). That being said, though, I have created a mini-book aiming to summarize some of my experiences from this semester. I hope that future students who decide to organize similar initiatives would find some of what I included in my mini-book helpful.</p>

									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									<p>Through working on this initiative these past seven months, I have learned a lot about what education for liberation means, how to navigate the design process and work effectively with remote teams, as well as how to use reflection to propell future phases of initiatives. Without my mentors and team members, though, this entire project would have been impossible.</p>
