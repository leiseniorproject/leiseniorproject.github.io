								<p>Hey all! My name is Ning-Er and I am working on a project (tentatively) called the “Equity in Computing Education Lab.” I will be working on this project during period 1 this semester & Mr. Montero is my advisor. This semester, I hope to continue to develop an equity-focused initiative I started this past summer; I plan to continue to research, using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, how to implement effective ways to support traditionally underrepresented students in computing related courses and use those for my initiative. As part of my project, I will also continue to mentor our initiative's inaugural cohort of students. I plan to culminate my work by delivering a series of workshops and building a documentation site (or binders) that will guide schools to implement the framework I end up developing for establishing better support systems for CS students of traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. Ultimately, I hope to use my graduation project as an opportunity to gain more experience in research, leadership, and social innovation.</p>

								<p>A passage I found to be particularly interesting was “while the three "standards" we have described for academic writing might appear simple, they are devilishly hard to teach and even to observe in any given piece of writing. Would that the standards were as straightforward as "avoid the first person" or "use correct English" or "have a clear thesis." As our findings chapters will describe in detail, our informants tended to speak vaguely about what they regarded as "standards" and "conventions" in their fields, even though none of them had any hesitancy to say that they knew what the standards were” (Thaiss and Zawacki). I found this particularly insightful as it highlights the nuances of academic writing and English language in general. Here, the author suggests that writing shouldn’t be taught rotely with strict and rigid rules, for instance, “avoid XYZ.” I also agree with the authors that when it comes to learning to craft well written academic writing pieces, past experiences play a big role; in other words, practice is paramount.</p>
								<p>Another excerpt that struck me a lot was "writing for school often starts with an assigned text: A teacher hands you a book or essay to read and tells you to write an essay about it. But this isn't always--or perhaps even usually-how intellectual work begins" (Harris). By providing a specific example, Harris paints a striking picture depicting the arguably ineffective way in which writing assignments are assigned. Recalling my past experiences in humanities courses, I agree with Harris’ argument to a certain extent; while I do think that truly “intellectual” and academically rigorous work are usually spurred—inspired—by intrinsic motivations, not instructors’ orders, I would still argue that in order for students to reach a level capable of producing relatively intellectual works, they must first be trained through being as</p>

								<h2>Nov 29, 2020</h2>
								<p>I started my talk by providing a brief overview of my project, including a summary of the work I finished with my team over the summer and my research focus. I then summarised the case studies I did over this quarter, for instance, Freedom Schools and Ella Baker’s projects; we also spent some time discussing some of the social theory literature I read, including Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed.</p>
								<p>Afterwards, we started to talk about future plans I have for this project. Specifically, we talked about the feasibility of completing a paper related to the pilot study I did this summer, incorporating the literature/case studies I read about this past quarter. Towards the end of the talk, I talked about why I decided to pursue this project in the first place.</p>
								<p>Most certainly, having this conversation helped me a lot in figuring out my next steps for this project. Since then, I have finished writing the framework/curriculum guide portion of my project; I initially hoped to complete this part of my project by mid-December, so I think that my project is going smoother than I had expected. I am cautiously optimistic that I would be able to complete a 10 to 30-page paper (maybe even something similar in length/depth of an IB extended essay) before the end of January since, anyways, I basically have nothing to do, aside from TA-ing, between mid-December and late January.</p>
								<p>If anyone’s interested in seeing some of the books/articles I read for the project, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l7YTobW-vw4g90QLzn1OEUWaYbavDHSc/view?usp=sharing">this</a> is a pdf with the notes I took, including excerpts that either resonated with me a lot or I found to be incredibly insightful.</p>

								<p>My project is focused on supporting traditionally underrepresented students in computer science. This past summer, I collaborated with a team of other Rindge students in designing and teaching a 2-week virtual summer APCS/APCSP prep course associated with the CRLS MPP program. Since then, I have been working under the mentorship of my advisor and Ms. Fitzgerald in understanding theories and essential literature in the topic of education for liberation and including those ideas into my project. During my midterm presentation, for instance, I talked about incorporating wisdom from Ella Baker and Paulo Freire into the next phase of our project, which entails working with our current cohort of students in redesigning the summer CS curriculum. Recently, I have been working with other CRLS students in designing a school-wide equity-focused hackathon; once we figure out the logistics of this one-week virtual event, we would invite our cohort of summer students to volunteer in debugging / Q&A sessions during the hackathon. As a high school senior, this project matters a lot to me. Throughout these four years of high school, I have studied computer science in various settings, including taking CS classes at Rindge, self-studying, attending 24-hour hackathon events, and programming as part of internships and projects in the States, France, and Taiwan. Having had these experiences, I understand the importance of amplifying opportunities and providing support systems for new programmers from underrepresented groups in computing. With this project, my team and I hope to be able to encourage students of more backgrounds at Rindge to try CS.</p>
								<p>In terms of launching ambitious social innovation initiatives, from my experiences, I think that it is important to understand the “field” in which your project would be situated. Regarding my initiative focused on Equity in Computing, I spent the first few months looking into different types of sources regarding existing opinions and case studies. For instance, I talked to different students and teachers at Rindge; I also read about relative initiatives from around the world. Personally, when launching new projects, I think it is worth dedicating at least two months to just understanding the field and potential problems to solve. Afterwards, when iterating through different ideas, teams should still run their ideas through different people; this is similar to how many startups choose to conduct focus groups. Ultimately, I think social innovation initiatives rely on iteratively building new knowledge of the unique set of problems they work to solve.</p>

								<h2>Summary of Roadblocks I encountered along the way.</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Around late September, I wasn't really sure where and how to navigate familiarizing myself with sources related to educatio for liberation. I resolved this by talking to my advisor, Mr. Montero, asking him for his advice. Ultimately, he helped me craft a reading list.</li>
									<li>After my research phase, I encountered another roadblock: this time, I was deciding between writing a senior thesis culminating my experiences ad continuing to read about initiatives and developing more. In the end, after talking to advisors, I decided to continue to work o developing initiatives and saving the senior thesis idea for another time.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>An overview of successes and surprises I encountered during my project development process.</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>I thought that reading Freire's Pedagogy would take much more time than it acutally did.</li>
									<li>The last phase of this project (planning the hackathon) was completely unexpected, although planning a hackathon has been a dream since attending one during my freshman year.</li>
								</ul>


								<hr>
								<h2>Aspirations that arose while working on this project.</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Before working on this project, I didn't know that I would find education studies to be one of the favorite topics I have studied so far. After spending so may months on my project, I am looking forward to take education related social science courses at college, and even serving as a research assistant for professors.</li>
									<li>I regained my interest for project/product development/management while working on my Senior Project. Although I spent a lot of time working on personal projects similar to this during my sophomore year, while in France, I forgot about them once I started my junior year in Massachusetts.</li>
								</ul>

								<hr>
								<h2>Misc: meetings, connections, community partners, and more.</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>This semester, I've also been a teaching assistant for AP Calculus BC. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DJjM7AmTrI8tx4O3akfGb0ivkQ0oNYxTCtMSy838EYY/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is my final product for my teaching assistantship seminar.</li>
									<li>My collaborators on the initiatives I talked about: Summer MPP team & CS Club hackathon organization team</li>
